# ConEmu, cygwin/msys and ssh-agent

Article is under construction, you may find following links and paragraphs useful.

## The key

When `ssh-agent` starts it defines two [environment](WindowsEnvironment.md) variables,
`SSH_AGENT_PID` and `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, which must be exported to your
[shell](TerminalVsShell.md).

On Unix systems or in cygwin ssh-agent may be started as follows:

~~~
eval $(ssh-agent)   # Create agent and environment variables
~~~

That would be nice if you are working in the single-tab console environment,
but what about ConEmu?

The answer is simple.
Just [export these variables](ConEmuEnvironment.html#Export_variables)
to the ConEmu GUI and all running consoles
([Tabs](Tabs.html) and [Panes](Panes.html)).

~~~
eval $(ssh-agent)           # Create agent and environment variables
ConEmuC -export=ALL SSH_*   # Export variables to ConEmu and all its tabs
~~~

The only drawback is a [limitation](ConEmuEnvironment.html#Export_variables)
of the implemented export method - existing cygwin tabs will not get these variables,
only new cygwin consoles will get them.

SSH agent working with @ConEmuMaximus5 and Git Bash. For multiple
tabs. Load your keys just once, use everywhere.

Using the [bash script](http://superuser.com/a/141241/139371) and an alias `sagent`.


### <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2001-06/msg00537.html">CygWin profile modification</a>

This solution does not relates to ConEmu at first glance but may be useful anyway.



{% comment %}
You may want to use ssh-agent and ssh-add to load the key into memory.
ssh will try identities from ssh-agent automatically if it can find them.
Commands would be

eval $(ssh-agent) # Create agent and environment variables
ssh-add ~/.ssh/1234-identity
ssh-agent is a user daemon which holds unencrypted ssh keys in memory. ssh finds it based on environment variables which ssh-agent outputs when run. Using eval to evaluate this output creates the environment variables.  ssh-add is the command which manages the keys memory. The agent can be locked using ssh-add. A default lifetime for a key can be specified when ssh-agent is started, and or specified for a key when it is added.

You might also want to setup a ~/.ssh/config file to supply the port and key definition. (See `man ssh_config for more options.)

host 22.33.44.55
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/1234-identity
    Port 1234
Single quoting the ssh command will prevent shell expansion which is needed for ~ or $HOME. You could use the full or relative path to the key in single quotes.

** without use of ssh-agent

   rsync -avz -e "ssh -p1234  -i $HOME/.ssh/1234-identity" ...
or full path to the key:

  rsync -avz -e "ssh -p1234  -i /home/username/.ssh/1234-identity" ...
Tested with rsync 3.0.9 on Ubuntu
