# There are a lot of answers in docs and existing issues

* Do not post questions if the answer exists in docs.
* Do not post issues if the same one has been posted already.

The answers for these questions and issues take developers' time,
and they will be, in fact, just a reposts of existing information.

Please respect other users and developers time they spent
looking for solutions and writing docs!

Moreover, you will spend much less time by reading existing page,
than posting new issue and waiting for the answer.

So, why do not to search?


## Looking for a setting

ConEmu has a lot of [settings](Settings.html), [switches](CommandLine.html),
[macros](GuiMacro.html), [hotkeys](KeyboardShortcuts.html) and options...

Both [Settings](Settings.html) and [Help/About](AboutDialog.html)
dialogs has ‘Search’ field.
Just open a dialog, press `Ctrl+F` and type sought for text.
Wait a little or press `Enter` to do the search.


## Officially maintained sources

Use official documentation and existing issues.

* [Search within docs](#search-field)

* [Search within old issues](https://github.com/Maximus5/conemu-old-issues/issues?q=is:issue#js-issues-search)
