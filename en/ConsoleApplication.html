<p>Console application is a specially compiled windows executable which is working with in/out streams and (usually) do not have any graphical interface. </p>
<p>Few examples: cmd.exe, powershell.exe, sh.exe, dism.exe, java.exe (but not a javaw.exe), python.exe, telnet.exe and so on. </p>
<p>These applications may be runned in the terminals only (<a href="TerminalVsShell.html">TerminalVsShell</a>). Terminal accepts user input, sends it to application input stream, reads application output and displays it in its own window as text. </p>
<p>Few terminal examples: conhost.exe (but not a ‘cmd.exe’ like many users think), <a href="ConEmu.html">ConEmu</a>, ConsoleZ, mintty, PuTTY, KiTTY, Xshell and many others. </p>
<p>One more note. Terminals may be ‘local’ and ‘remote’. Remote terminals connect to remote hosts to run applications remotely. </p>
