# Using Git for Windows

Native and full-featured set of [Git SCM](http://git-scm.com/) tools.

* [Version 2.x.x](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)
* [Version 1.9.5 (deprecated)](https://github.com/msysgit/msysgit/releases)


## Starting shell

Git-for-Windows package provides a lot of msys tools,
useful for users used to Unix environment. So, anyone
may easily run `bash.exe` prepared for Git environment.

~~~
git-cmd.exe --no-cd --command=usr/bin/bash.exe -l -i
~~~

When you start ConEmu first time, it will create a task `{Git bash}`
with similar contents.

Also, you may run in ConEmu tab `git-bash.exe`, but this is not recommended,
because it runs `mintty.exe`, which is another terminal, actually.
And of course, ConEmu can't change behavior and appearance
of [ChildGui](ChildGui.html) applications.



### Use proper sh.exe from version 2.x

**NB** Don't run `/bin/sh.exe` as your shell ([root process](RootProcess.html))
in ConEmu tab! This is just a wrapper for ‘full version’ located in `/usr/bin/`
folder. That's why ConEmu will not be able to determine if your tab has running
process, or there is a shell only.

Run `/usr/bin/sh.exe -l -i` to get proper behavior of
[tab closing confirmation](SettingsConfirm.html#id2756)
option.



## Colorizing fix for Solarized color scheme  {#Solarized}

Fix for [Solarized color scheme](SolarizedColors.html).

~~~
git config --global color.diff.new "green bold"
git config --global color.status.updated "green bold"
git config --global color.branch.current "green bold"
~~~

Using Far Manager as editor (commit texts). I'm using
[FarRun](https://github.com/Maximus5/FarPlugins/tree/master/FarRun/Release)
to simplify call of `far.exe`.

~~~
git config --global core.editor "farrun -e1:1"
~~~



## cygwin_exception in less.exe  {#cygwin-exception}

When updated my git to `PortableGit-2.3.5.8-dev-preview-32-bit.7z.exe` (obsolete build),
bumped into strange exception.

~~~
2 [main] less 3872 cygwin_exception::open_stackdumpfile: Dumping stack trace to less.exe.stackdump
~~~

The exception actually happens at `msys-ncursesw6.dll!664465b1`.

After some investigations found how to fix that.
The problem was in `TERM` environment variable, it was set to `msys`.
After removing that variable (clearing it) git's less begins to work normally.
