<h1>Cygwin and pty related issues</h1>

<p>I have many reports about cygwin. And most of them are related to one cygwin behavior: when it detects real win32 console, it process all ANSI sequences internally, so ConEmu does not receive ANSI at all. </p>
<p>Yep, users said: ‘It is working in mintty’. </p>
<p>Answer is simple: mintty is not a ‘real’ console, all its magic is done with pipes. </p>
<p>On the one hand - cygwin detects ‘pipe’ mode (that mode may be named ‘pty’ or ‘cygwin terminal’) and do not process ANSI internally, but just bypass them to terminal. </p>
<p>On the other hand - many console applications fails in mintty (most known to me - PowerShell and Far Manager). </p>
<p>ConEmu is hybrid terminal. It support all functionality Windows offers to console applications AND is able to process <a href="AnsiEscapeCodes.html">ANSI sequences</a>, all magic is done by <a href="ConEmuHk.html">hooking Windows API</a>. </p>
<p>But cygwin do not know about <a href="AnsiEscapeCodes.html">ConEmu abilities</a> and I do not know any way to force cygwin to do ‘right’ things (send ANSI to ConEmu consoles). </p>
<p>May be in future I&#x27;ll find a way to combine pty and real console features, but at the moment, may be, better and faster way is request the ‘feature’ from cygwin developers. </p>
