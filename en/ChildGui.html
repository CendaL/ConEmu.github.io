<p>Running simple ChildGui is a &quot;side-feature&quot;. ConEmu can&#x27;t control or customize those apps. In most cases console versions are preferred because they are running in the ConEmu &quot;native&quot; mode. </p>
<p><img src="../img/ConEmuChildGui.png" title="ConEmu with two ChildGui"> </p>
<p>ChildGui is a term defines GUI applications which are drawing their contents itself using <a href="WinApi.html">WinApi</a>. Few examples: PuTTY, mintty, notepad, GViM and so on. Don&#x27;t confuse them with <a href="ConsoleApplication.html">ConsoleApplication</a>&#x27;s which are specially compiled. ChildGui, even they have their own console-like interfaces are not <a href="ConsoleApplication.html">ConsoleApplication</a>&#x27;s. </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> To be able to ‘integrate’ ChildGui into ConEmu, your application window must be <strong>resizeable</strong>! For example, if your PuTTY settings locks its window size to certain ‘rows x cols’ values, its window is non-resizeable, and ConEmu will not integrate it into ConEmu&#x27;s tabs. Because it is not ‘possible’ to resize that ChildGui when ConEmu window is to be resizing! </p>
<p>One more note about <strong>hotkeys</strong>. When you are running ChildGui, all keypressed must be passed to that application. That&#x27;s why most of ConEmu hotkeys will be inaccessible. With exception of hotkeys types ‘Global’, ‘Local’ and hotkeys with ‘Win’ modifier, if option ‘Install keyboard hooks’ is <strong>enabled</strong>. </p>
<p>At last. How to run ChildGui in ConEmu? Absolutely the same way you do that for simple <a href="ConsoleApplication.html">ConsoleApplication</a>&#x27;s. For example, from ‘Create new console dialog’. </p>
