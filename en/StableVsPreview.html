<p>Choose your version. </p>
<p>Thought, it must be obvious, that if one don&#x27;t want new features <strong>and bugfixes</strong> - he may stuck on stable. But it is strange (for me) enough when user reports a bug which was fixed months ago... </p>
<h2><a name="Stable"></a>Stable<a href="#Stable" class="section_anchor"></a></h2>
<p>This is «Stable» version of <a href="ConEmu.html">ConEmu</a>. </p>
<p>Please, don&#x27;t think that «Stable» is «totally bug-free», in the <a href="ConEmu.html">ConEmu</a> project some builds are marked as «Stable» when they are ready (in my opinion) for public. </p>
<p>But! Bugfixes, patches, features will not be applied to «Stable» builds until next «Stable» comes! </p>
<p>On the other hand, that means that «Stable» builds will not contains breaking changes, side by side with bugfixes and new features. </p>
<h2><a name="Preview"></a>Preview<a href="#Preview" class="section_anchor"></a></h2>
<p>This is «Preview» (also known as «Release Preview») version of <a href="ConEmu.html">ConEmu</a>. Most of latests bugfixes and features, but these builds comes with delay in comparison with «Developer» build. Trying to avoid creating new bugs :) </p>
<p><strong>Recommended</strong> for most users. </p>
<h2><a name="Alpha"></a>Alpha<a href="#Alpha" class="section_anchor"></a></h2>
<p>This is «Developer» (also known as «Alpha») version of <a href="ConEmu.html">ConEmu</a>. Latests bugfixes and features, but some builds may be unstable due to changes in the code. </p>
<p>However, most of these builds are suitable for most users. </p>
