# How you may help with documentation

Have you seen spelling error in the program interface or documentation?
Can you suggest better translation or add some text to the documentation?
Any suggestions are appreciated!


## Documentation  {#documentation}

Documentation seen by user: [TableOfContents.html](TableOfContents.html)

Page sources: [github.com](https://github.com/ConEmu/ConEmu.github.io)

English pages are located in the ‘en’ subfolder.

All settings dialogs are stored in the file
[ConEmu.rc](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/blob/alpha/src/ConEmu/ConEmu.rc)
and tooltips for their controls in the file
[ConEmu.rc2](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/blob/alpha/src/ConEmu/ConEmu.rc2)


## Why it is so hard  {#why-it-is-so-hard}

Many pages were written during long time, by occasion,
in my free time, in language I was ‘thinking’ at that moment.
For example, I'm writing [WhatsNew](Whats_New.html) in English because
there is no time to translate it or write in two languages simultaneously.
