<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

Documentation seen by user: [TableOfContents.html](TableOfContents.html)

Page sources: [github.com](https://github.com/ConEmu/ConEmu.github.io)

English pages are located in ‘en’ subfolder.

All settings dialogs are stored in the file
[ConEmu.rc](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/blob/alpha/src/ConEmu/ConEmu.rc)
and tooltips for their controls in the file
[ConEmu.rc2](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/blob/alpha/src/ConEmu/ConEmu.rc2)


<h2 id="why-it-is-so-hard">Why it is so hard</h2>

Many pages were written during long time, by occasion,
in my free time, in language I was ‘thinking’ at that moment.
For example, I'm writing [WhatsNew](Whats_New.html) in English because
there is no time to translate it or write in two languages simultaneously.
