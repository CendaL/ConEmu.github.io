<p><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653" rel="nofollow">Process Explorer</a> is handy and useful tool which can show you all about running process in your Windows system. </p>
<p>For example, it can show all environment variables defined in selected process - just open process properties and go to &quot;Environment&quot; tab. </p>
<p>Also, it can show all loaded dll-files in your process. </p>
<p>BTW, Far Manager plugin &quot;Process list&quot; can do same things. </p>
