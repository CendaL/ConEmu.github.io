# High ConEmu I/O rate and CPU consumption

Some process monitoring tools (Process Hacker or Anvir for example)
may show high I/O rate of `ConEmuC[64].exe` and `ConEmu[64].exe` processes.
Windows 8 Task Manager do not do that by the way.

The reason is simple - ConEmu utilizes
[Named Pipes](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365780.aspx)
for interprocess communication with [RealConsole](RealConsole.html)
and graphic part (GUI). Named Pipes are not related to **disk** activities at all
and I believe these tools just confuse users summarizing both
real disk activites and ‘in-memory’ transfers.

Well, most of I/O transfer actually consists of two parts (types):

* Continuous scanning of the [RealConsole](RealConsole.html) surface
* and transmitting real changes to the GUI.

We can't decrease throughput of first part without decreasing the responsiveness
of ConEmu but there are two options on the
[Features](http://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsFeatures.html#cpu-consuming)
settings page allowing to dramatically descrease I/O rate of the **inactive**
consoles ([Tabs](Tabs.html) or [Panes](Panes.html)) notably
‘Sleep in background’ and ‘Retard inactive panes’.

The thoughput of the second I/O part can't be controlled directly by user,
but it has linear relationship with the number of changes occurred in the
[RealConsole](RealConsole.html). However, ConEmu tries to limit its ‘speed’
to something about 60 [FPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate).
And if there were no changes in the console, there would be no I/O transfer
of this type.
