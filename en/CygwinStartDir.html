<i>cygwin, mingw, ConEmu and start up directory</i>
-->
<p>One of the most asked questions about cygwin using - how to run its shell in the specified working directory. </p>
<p>Finally, thanks to csbdess, <a title="can't set working dir for cygwin consoles from commandline" class=closed_ref href="http://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/issues/detail?id=1552">&nbsp;Issue1552&nbsp;</a>#15, the problem was identified. </p>
<p>Cygwin always do ‘<tt>cd &quot;${HOME}&quot;</tt>’ from <tt>/etc/profile</tt>. </p>
<pre class="prettyprint"># Make sure we start in home unless invoked by CHERE
if [ ! -z &quot;${CHERE_INVOKING}&quot; ]; then
  unset CHERE_INVOKING
else
  cd &quot;${HOME}&quot; || echo &quot;WARNING: Failed attempt to cd into ${HOME}!&quot;
fi</pre>
<p>So, if you do not like that behaviour, read below for solutions. </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>. MinGW (at least version installed on my PC) does not have checking for <tt>CHERE_INVOKING</tt> environment variable. There is just <tt>cd &quot;$HOME&quot;</tt> at the end of <tt>/MinGW/msys/1.0/etc/profile</tt>. You may change that file yourself to get the same checks as cygwin. </p>

<h1 id="h0"><a name="CHERE"></a>CHERE<a href="#CHERE" class="section_anchor"></a></h1>
<p>Cygwin will not do ‘<tt>cd &quot;${HOME}&quot;</tt>’ if environment variable <tt>CHERE_INVOKING</tt> is defined. So, if you run your shell (bash) as following, shell will be started in proper working directory. </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">set CHERE_INVOKING=1 &amp; c:\cygwin\bin\sh.exe --login -i</pre>
<p>Thought, you can, but must not change the contents of your <tt>/etc/profile</tt> commenting ‘<tt>cd &quot;${HOME}&quot;</tt>’... Because you can change cygwin behaviour within <a href="ConEmu.html">ConEmu</a> tasks or command line. </p>

<h1><a name="ConEmuWorkDir"></a>ConEmuWorkDir<a href="#ConEmuWorkDir" class="section_anchor"></a></h1>
<p>Another workaround - do <tt>cd</tt> to the working folder in your shell profile (<tt>.bashrc</tt>, <tt>.zshrc</tt>, etc.) </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">if [ -n &quot;${ConEmuWorkDir}&quot; ]; then
  cd &quot;$ConEmuWorkDir&quot;
fi</pre>
<p><a href="ConEmu.html">ConEmu</a> set <tt>ConEmuWorkDir</tt> to the console startup directory, so you may use it in your scripts. Read more about <a href="ConEmuEnvironment.html">ConEmuEnvironment</a> in wiki. </p>
<p><!-- Portable to all POSIX shells:
 </p>
<p>if [ -n &quot;${foobar+1}&quot; ]; then
   echo &quot;foobar is defined&quot;
 else
   echo &quot;foobar is not defined&quot;
 fi
 Make that ${foobar:+1} if you want to treat foobar the same way whether it is empty or not defined. You can also use ${foobar-} to get an empty string when foobar is undefined and the value of foobar otherwise (or put any other default value after the -).
 </p>
<p>In ksh, if foobar is declared but not defined, as in typeset -a foobar, then ${foobar+1} expands to the empty string.
 </p>
<p>Zsh doesn&#x27;t have variables that are declared but not set: typeset -a foobar creates an empty array.
 </p>
<p>In bash, arrays behave in a different and surprising way. ${a+1} only expands to 1 if a is a non-empty array, e.g.
 </p>
<p>typeset -a a; echo ${a+1}    # prints nothing
 e=(); echo ${e+1}            # prints nothing!
 f=(&#x27;&#x27;); echo ${f+1}          # prints 1
 The same principle applies to associative arrays: array variables are treated as defined if they have a non-empty set of indices.
 </p>
<p>A different, bash-specific way of testing whether a variable of any type has been declared is to check whether it&#x27;s listed in ${!PREFIX*}:
 </p>
<p>case &quot; ${!foobar*} &quot; in
   *&quot; foobar &quot;*) echo &quot;foobar is declared&quot;;;
   *) echo &quot;foobar is not declared&quot;;;
 esac
 This is equivalent to testing the return value of typeset -p foobar or declare -p foobar.
 </p>
<p>In bash, like in ksh, set -o nounset; typeset -a foobar; echo $foobar triggers an error in the attempt to expand the undefined variable foobar. Unlike in ksh, set -o nounset; foobar=(); echo $foobar (or echo &quot;${foobar[@]}&quot;) also triggers an error.
 </p>
<p>Note that in all situations described here, ${foobar+1} expands to 1 if and only if $foobar would cause an error under set -o nounset.
