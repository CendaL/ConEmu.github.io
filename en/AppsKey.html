<i>What is an Apps key?</i>
-->
<p>This key (mentioned as <tt>VK_APPS</tt> in <tt>WinUser.h</tt>) located between <strong>RightWin</strong> and <strong>RightShift</strong> on most <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Klawiatura_maszynistki.jpg" rel="nofollow">keyboard layouts</a>. </p>
<p>Sometimes it&#x27;s called <strong>Application/Menu</strong>. Thought, it is not correct in Windows because <tt>VK_MENU</tt> (from <tt>WinUser.h</tt>) refers to the <strong>Alt</strong> key in fact. </p>
