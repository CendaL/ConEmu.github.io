* This build changes the download procedure used within automatic updates.
    ConEmu.exe (GUI) do not call WinInet functions anymore, instead it calls
    the downloader tool (ConEmuC.exe is an only option at the moment).
    This will eliminate accidental crashes of GUI after resume from sleep.
* The downloader itself has new options.
    If user omit dst file name - try to get it from Url.
    If `-` was specified as dst file name or output is redirected - just write contents to stdout.
    New switch `-agent <name>` was implemented.
