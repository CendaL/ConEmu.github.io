* gh#438: No newlines in log files after prompts (cygwin/msys).
  Cygwin/msys shells do not write LF to screen unless they
  were started from ConEmu's cygwin/msys connector.
  Therefore we have to do some magic to ‘detect’ line feeds...
* Update terminals module to v0.7
* In some cases PID of terminal-connector was not shown in the StatusBar.
* Xterm's alternative screen was not cleared on activating.
* gh#351: Allow changing URL for retrieving version location on Settings/Update.
* gh#351: Use `https://conemu.github.io/version.ini` by default.
* Changes in processing of default hotkey `Win+X`.
  * It runs whole task contents, but not only first ‘tab’ from task;
  * If no one task was marked as ‘Default shell’, run default `COMSPEC`
    with arguments ` /k "%ConEmuBaseDir%\CmdInit.cmd"`.
