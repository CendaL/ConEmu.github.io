* Command ‘ConEmuC -ConInfo’ prints current console tech info.
* Let intercept GetWindowLong(GWL_STYLE) for console window handle (ref gh-727, gh-719).
  Far 3.0 since build 4698 tries to query GWL_STYLE for console window?
* l10n. New language resources.
* gh-735: Add all marked tasks to Jump List, use TaskBar history limit value only for History items.
* gh-740: Conversion to linux path on paste was not working for ‘Single line’ mode.
* Option ‘Autoupdate’ on Settings/TaskBar/Windows 7 Taskbar.
  If checked, Jump Lists will be updated automatically when user check
  the ‘Taskbar jump lists’ checkbox in Task properties.
* Do not add new Tasks to Jump List by default, let user explicitly check ‘Taskbar jump lists’.
* Installer (MSI): Don't suggest Far Manager's folder by default.
