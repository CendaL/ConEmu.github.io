* Terminal modes were not displayed on Settings/Info page.
* gh-716: Cygwin/msys connector output was broken after starting nano.
* gh-722: Treat Unicode range U+2700..U+27BF as double width glyphs.
* gh-718: Minimal cursor size option was ignored for invalid console cursor size (zero size).
* gh-719: Write cursor information and console window rect to log file.
* Print more console information in `ConEmuC -checkunicode`.
* gh-723: Let ‘Minimize/Restore’ hotkey act in spite of ‘Always on top’ mode.
* Don't process (append) environment variable twice (ref gh-724).
  Example: `PATH=%ConEmuBaseDir%\Scripts;%PATH%;C:\Tools\Arc`
  So, do not add `%ConEmuBaseDir%\Scripts;` and `;C:\Tools\Arc`
  if they already exist in PATH. Only explicit comparison is done,
  so, if `C:\Tools\Arc` is in the middle of current `%PATH%`,
  it would be processed (appended).
* Fix: Console progress `0%` was detected during tab startup (regression 69439a3).
* Default task {Far}: don't double plugin folders to avoid doubled lines in F11 (Far 1.x and Far 2.x `/p` switch problem).
* gh-700: Show tab icon for Far editors and viewers if ‘Far windows’ option is off.
