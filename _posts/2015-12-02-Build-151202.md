* When ConEmu was started as a child window (InsideParent) it behaves as it has no focus.
* Ensure that all child windows are closed properly on termination (InsideParent).
* Option ‘Activate split/pane on mouse hover’ was not working in InsideParent mode.
* Execution of ‘-GuiMacro:PID’ was failed if ConEmu.exe was in InsideParent.
* Don't allow to execute ‘-GuiMacro:...’ on wrong instance.
* Increase debugger backscroll even if it was started in ConEmu tab.
* XTerm keys fixup (F1..F4, BackSpace, Alt+Char).
* Disable ‘Ctrl+Backspace - delete word leftward to the text cursor’ in cygwin/msys connector.
  Ctrl+BS is posted as "\x1F" and it may be configured in the `.inputrc` as following:
~~~
  # Ctrl-BS - kill word on the left
  "\x1F": "\C-w"
