* Fix bad XML format for GuiMacro GetInfo Root.
* gh#491: Example Far Macro `ConEmu.CtrlShiftT.lua` had wrong hotkey.
* Add ‘Anti-aliasing’ option for alternative font.
* Far Manager was not resized after splitting with Ctrl-Shift-O/E.
  Implement helper ForceFarResize and utilize it in both sync and async modes.
* gh#502, gh#446, gh#447: The algorithm of text drawing has changed significantly.
* Prevent double execution of script specified in "AutoRun" cmd's registry key.
  For example, when "cmd /k CmdInit.cmd" was started (default for {cmd} task)
  triggering `ver` command caused execution of `test.cmd` again.
