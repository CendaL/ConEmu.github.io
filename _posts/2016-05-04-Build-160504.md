* gh-660: Fix crash on ConEmu.exe exit (32-bit).
* Separate process creation from module/inject activities.
  On Settings/Info/Debug page new ‘Exec’ option shows only
  ShellExecute and CreateProcess activities.
  The ‘Shell’ options is unchanged: ‘Exec’ + injects + modules.
* l10n: Update resources (Debug activities).
